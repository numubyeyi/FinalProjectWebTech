PROJECT NAME: E_HEALTH CARD

i. Project Requirements

Project Description


In manual system when patient approaches multiple medical treatment at different Health Facilities, there is no way doctor can access the information of previous treatment information of that patients and he/she has to start from zero, he/she may repeat the exam test and give her/him the same medicine because he/she has no information about previous treatment. And that is deficient and bad service for that patient. The manual keeping health records was not accessible and not secure. Digitizing details of patient’s medical information helps meet these challenges in an efficient way as in this format, information can be circulated with ease irrespective of time and location. E-Health Card will help a patient to view it’s medical record wherever, whenever, and however he/she want,  and E-Health Card will also help a Doctor to know the previous medical records of a patient so that he/she can have a hint of what he is going to do in advance.
So, the main objective of this system is  to help patients carry their health records electronically and be able to share those records with the doctors in order to ease the doctor’s job to effectively take care of the patient based on those records.

ii. Project Plan

Scope

In my project I have planned to deal on two parts which are web application and android application but because of time constraints I’m able to work on web application only.

So,at this time  my system will deal with many functions but the main are that i will register some main master data, patient personal information, patient medical records and the medical records  that are supposed to be accessed by the patient and by the doctor using web application.
My system also registers this kind of medical information: biometrics data, consultation data (symptoms), name of the exam, results and prescription data (name of medicine and other comment).



Limitations

In this system i want to deal with all kind of hospitals but for now i don’t support to deal of all kind of hospitals, my system doesn’t have model led way of registering medicine, i also don’t deal with hospitalization, also in my web application there is some master data that doesn’t have UI like departments, exams, roles. i put them in database. 

Assumptions

In this system i will deal with patient with national Ids and all hospitals must have access to the internet.
